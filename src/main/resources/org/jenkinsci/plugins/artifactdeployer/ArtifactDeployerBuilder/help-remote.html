        Artifacts will be deployed in the specified output directory.<br/>
        The remote location must be accessible through the build machine (controller and agent node).<br/>
        If you want to have the ability to download deployed artifacts through the Jenkins dashboard,
        the location must be accessible from the Jenkins controller.<br/>
        Make sure the Jenkins process have the right permissions to write to the remote location.<br/>
        For example with a shared NFS storage, '/nfs/build/deploy/${BUILD_ID}' can be a valid value on a Unix machine.
